# NBA-Data
This project scrapes data from three different tables on NBA statistics from the Basketball Reference website. This was done to analyze how the NBA's game has changed over the last 40 years. After scraping and cleaning the data, I analyze various data, from three-point attempts and rebounds to usage rate. Lastly, I report, analyze, and validate my findings, comparing them to what I know as a fan, as well as the many articles that have been written describing changes in the NBA. 

This project is useful because it allowed me to develop and portray my Python skills, as well as my Data Analysis skills. I was able to go through the steps one must go through while performing a Data Analysis project. This project allowed me to learn more about Python as a whole, as well as the various, often powerful functionalities that can be used to analyze data. Lastly, even though I've been a basketball fan for the last nearly 15+ years, and have witnessed these changes, delving deeper into the data allowed me to understand why these changes have happened, and are happening right now. 

I am solely responsible for this project, its coding, and the analysis. However, it is far from perfect, and I can definitely use some insight.
